Introduction
------------

TowerSE is a systems engineering tower model for cylindrical shell wind turbine towers.  A beam finite element code, `pBEAM <https://github.com/WISDEM/pBEAM>`_ is used for the structural analysis.  Buckling is estimated using methods from Eurocode [ref] and GL [ref].  Wind speed distributions from simple power-law, log-law, or user-defined profiles, wave speed distributions come from linear wave theory.  Cylinder drag data is used for both wind and wave loading.  A textbook model is used for soil stiffness properties [ref].
